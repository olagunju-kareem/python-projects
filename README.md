## Python Projects Repository
Welcome to my **Python Projects** repository! 👋

I'm Kareem Olagunju, a Civil Engineering student at the University of Ibadan (UI), Nigeria. This repo serves as my personal collection of Python scripts and mini-projects as I progress 
in learning Python programming.

While I'm currently focusing on general Python skills (automation, file handling, data processing, etc.), my long-term goal is to build practical engineering tools—especially ones useful 
for civil/structural engineering—like calculators for beam deflection, reinforced concrete design helpers, survey data processors, hydraulic tools, and more.

## Current Projects
| File | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| file_sorter.py |	A script that automatically organizes files in a directory by extension into categorized folders (Documents, Images, Videos, etc.). Handles name collisions gracefully. |
| logger.py |	A simple customizable logging utility (details coming soon as I expand it). |

More projects will be added regularly as I complete exercises, challenges, and real-world tools.

## Future Plans (Engineering-Focused Ideas)
- Structural analysis helpers (e.g., moment distribution, truss solver)
- Reinforced concrete section design tools
- Surveying data processing scripts
- Hydraulic calculations (Manning's equation, pipe flow)
- Geotechnical tools (bearing capacity, settlement)
- Simple CAD/data export utilities

## Requirements
All scripts are written in pure Python 3.x with only standard library dependencies (unless specified otherwise in individual files).

To run any script:
```Bash
python filename.py
```

## How to Use
1. Clone the repo:
```Bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-projects.git
```
2. Navigate to the project folder and run the desired script. 
Feel free to fork, suggest improvements, or open issues if you find bugs!
